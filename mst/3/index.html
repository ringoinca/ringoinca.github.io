<p><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/comp/">Theory of computation</a> (computability and complexity) forms the basis for modern cryptography:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an <a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/comp/algorithm/">algorithm</a>?
<ul>
<li>An algorithm is a <em>computational method</em> for solving an <em>abstract problem</em>.</li>
<li>An algorithm takes as input a set <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> of <em>problem instances</em>, and outputs a solution from the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <em>problem solutions</em>.</li>
<li>An algorithm is represented in a well-defined <a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/comp/language/">formal language</a>.</li>
<li>An algorithm must be able to be represented within a finite amount of time and space (otherwise it cannot be actually used for solving any problem).</li>
<li>An algorithm can be simulated by any <em>model of computation</em>:
<ul>
<li><em>Turing machine</em> is a model implemented through internal <em>states</em>.</li>
<li><em>λ-calculus</em> is a model based on pure <em>functions</em>.</li>
<li>All Turing-complete models are equivalent in their computational abilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Computability: Not every abstract problem is solvable. Notably, there exists a decision problem for which some instances can neither be accepted nor rejected by any algorithm. (<em>Undecidable problem</em>)</li>
<li>Complexity:
<ul>
<li>The complexity class P is closed under polynomial-time reductions. Hence, proof by reduction can be a useful technique in provable security of cryptosystems.</li>
<li>If one can prove that P = NP, then one-way functions do not exist. This would invalidate the construction of cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators (PRG). (<em>Pseudorandom generator theorem</em>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In many scenarios, we assume that an algorithm acts as a stateless computation and takes independent and identically distributed inputs. It differs from a computer program conceptually.</li>
<li>An algorithm can be either <em>deterministic</em> or <em>probabilistic</em>.
<ul>
<li>For probabilistic algorithms, the source of randomness may be from:
<ul>
<li>External (physical) input of high entropy.</li>
<li>Pseudorandomness: Since everything computational is deterministic, the existence of pseudorandomness relies on the (assumed) existence of one-way functions and PRGs.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, pseudorandom generators used in probabilistic algorithms yield random bits according to the uniform distribution, so it is worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic probability theory
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/math/probability/#discrete-uniform-distribution">Discrete uniform distribution</a>. <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{U}\{a,b\}\)</span>. The probability distribution where a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed (with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{b-a+1}\)</span>).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptographic schemes are defined as tuples of deterministic or probabilistic algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/intro/">Principles of modern cryptography</a>
<ul>
<li>Formal description of a <em>private-key encryption scheme</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Pi=(\mathsf{Gen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec})\)</span> with message space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>.
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Gen}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Dec}\)</span> are three algorithms.</li>
<li>Correctness: <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Dec}_k(\mathsf{Enc}_k(m)) = m\)</span>.</li>
<li>For the correctness equality to hold, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Dec}\)</span> should be deterministic.</li>
<li>Assume that we have access to a source of randomness, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Gen}\)</span> should choose a key at random thus is probabilistic. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Gen}\)</span> is deterministic and always generate the same key, such an encryption scheme is of no practical use and easy to break.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span> can be either deterministic (e.g., as in one-time pads) or probabilistic. Later we will see that for an encryption scheme to be CPA-secure, <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span> should be probabilistic.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Kerchhoffs’ principle (Shannon’s maxim)</strong> claims that a cryptosystem should be secure even if the scheme <span class="math inline">\((\mathsf{Gen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec})\)</span> is known to the adversary. That is, security should rely solely on the secrecy of the private key.</li>
<li>Provable security of cryptosystems requires:
<ol type="1">
<li>Formal definition of security;</li>
<li>Minimal assumptions;</li>
<li>Rigorous proofs of security.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Common attacks and notions of security:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ciphertext-only attack</strong>.
<ul>
<li>A cryptosystem is said to be <em>perfectly secret</em> if it is theoretically unbreakable under ciphertext-only attack.</li>
<li>A cryptosystem is said to be <em>computationally secure</em> if it is resistant to ciphertext-only attack (by any polynomial-time adversary).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Known-plaintext attack (KPA)</strong>. A cryptosystem is <em>KPA-secure</em> if it is resistant to KPA.
<ul>
<li>KPA-security implies ciphertext-only security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chosen-plaintext attack (CPA)</strong>. A cryptosystem is <em>CPA-secure</em> (or <em>IND-CPA</em>) if it is resistant to CPA.
<ul>
<li>IND-CPA implies KPA-security.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA)</strong>. A cryptosystem is <em>CCA-secure</em> (or <em>IND-CCA1</em>) if it is resistant to CCA; furthermore, a cryptosystem is <em>IND-CCA2</em> if it is resistant to adaptive CCA (where the adversary may make further calls to the oracle, but may not submit the challenge ciphertext).
<ul>
<li>IND-CCA1 implies IND-CPA.</li>
<li>IND-CCA2 implies IND-CCA1. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of above mentioned definitions of security.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/perfect-secrecy/">Perfect secrecy</a>
<ul>
<li>Two equivalent definitions: (proof of equivalence uses Bayes’ theorem)
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr[M=m\,|\,C=c] = \Pr[M=m]\)</span>. (Observing a ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> does not leak any information about the underlying message <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr[\mathsf{Enc}_K(m)=c] = \Pr[\mathsf{Enc}_K(m&#39;)=c]\)</span>. (The adversary has no bias when distinguishing two messages if given only the ciphertext <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Perfect indistinguishability</strong> defined on adversarial indistinguishability experiment <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{PrivK}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}^\mathsf{eav}\)</span>:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr[\mathsf{PrivK}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}^\mathsf{eav} = 1] = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>. (No adversary can win the indistinguishability game with a probability better than random guessing)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perfect indistinguishability is equivalent to the definition of perfect secrecy.</li>
<li>The adversarial indistinguishability experiment is a very useful setting in defining provable security, e.g., the definition of computational indistinguishability: (for arbitrary input size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>)
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\Pr[\mathsf{PrivK}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}^\mathsf{eav}(n) = 1] \leq \frac{1}{2} + \mathsf{negl}(n)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{negl}(n)\)</span> is a negligible function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perfect secrecy implies that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| \geq |\mathcal{M}|\)</span>, i.e., the key space must be larger than the message space. If <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| &lt; |\mathcal{M}|\)</span>, then the scheme cannot be perfectly secure.</li>
<li><strong>Shannon’s theorem</strong>: If <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| = |\mathcal{M}| = |\mathcal{C}|\)</span>, an encryption scheme is perfectly secret iff:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathcal{K}\)</span> is chosen uniformly.</li>
<li>For every <span class="math inline">\(m \in \mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c \in \mathcal{C}\)</span>, there exists a unique <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathcal{K}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}_k(m) = c\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A brief, formalized overview of some classical ciphers, and their security:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/one-time-pad/">One-time pad (Vernam cipher)</a>: XOR cipher when <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| = |\mathcal{M}|\)</span>.
<ul>
<li>One-time pad is perfectly secret. The proof simply follows from Bayes’ theorem. (Also verified by Shannon’s theorem. While one-time pad was initially introduced in the 19th century and patented by G. Vernam in 1919, it was not until many years later Claude Shannon gave a formal definition of information-theoretical security and proved that one-time pad is a perfectly secret scheme in his groundbreaking paper. <a href="#ref-shannon1949communication"><span class="citation" data-cites="shannon1949communication">[1]</span></a>)</li>
<li>One-time pad is deterministic. Moreover, it is a reciprocal cipher (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc} = \mathsf{Dec}\)</span>).</li>
<li>One-time pad is <em>not</em> secure when the same key is applied in multiple encryptions, and it is <em>not</em> CPA-secure. In fact, an adversary can succeed in such indistinguishability experiments with probability 1.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/classical/shift/">Shift cipher</a>: Defined with key space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}=\{0,\dots,n-1\}\)</span>. (<span class="math inline">\(n=|\Sigma|\)</span>)
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}|=n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{M}|=n^\ell\)</span>.</li>
<li>Cryptanalysis using frequency analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/classical/substitution/">Substitution cipher</a>: Defined with key space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K} = \mathfrak{S}_\Sigma\)</span> (symmetric group on <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>).
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}|=n!\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{M}|=n^\ell\)</span>.</li>
<li>Cryptanalysis using frequency analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.soimort.org/crypto/classical/vigenere/">Vigenère cipher (poly-alphabetic shift cipher)</a>: Like (mono-alphabetic) shift cipher, but the key length is an (unknown) integer <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}|=n^t\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{M}|=n^\ell\)</span>. (Typically <span class="math inline">\(t \ll \ell\)</span>)</li>
<li>Cryptanalysis using Kasiski’s method, index of coincidence method and frequency analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Lessons learned from these classical ciphers: While perfect secrecy is easy to achieve (one-time pads), designing practical cryptographic schemes (with shorter keys, and computationally hard to break) can be difficult.</p>
<section id="where-do-random-bits-come-from" class="level2">
<h2>Where do random bits come from?</h2>
<p>The construction of private-key encryption schemes involves probabilistic algorithms. We simply assume that an unlimited supply of independent, unbiased random bits is available for these cryptographic algorithms. But in practice, this is a non-trivial issue, as the source of randomness must provide high-entropy data so as to accommodate cryptographically secure random bits.</p>
<p>In the perfectly secret scheme of one-time pads, the key generation algorithm <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Gen}\)</span> requires the access to a source of randomness in order to choose the uniformly random key <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathcal{K}\)</span>. Practically, high-entropy data may be collected via physical input or even fully written by hand with human labor.</p>
<p>Theoretically, without external intervention, we have:</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture 3.1.</strong> <em>Pseudorandom generators exist.</em></p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3.2. (Pseudorandom generator theorem)</strong> <em>Pseudorandom generators exist if and only if one-way functions exist.</em></p>
<p>Pseudorandomness is also a basic construction in CPA-secure encryption algorithms (<span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span>), e.g., in stream ciphers and block ciphers.</p>
<p>So what is an acceptable level of pseudorandomness, if we are not sure whether such generators theoretically exist? Intuitively, if one cannot distinguish between a “pseudorandom” string (generated by a PRG) and a truly random string (chosen according to the uniform distribution), we have confidence that the PRG is a good one. Various statistical tests have been designed for testing the randomness of PRGs.</p>
</section>
<section id="pseudorandomness-and-ind-cpa" class="level2">
<h2>Pseudorandomness and IND-CPA</h2>
<p>It holds true that:</p>
<p><strong>Corollary 3.3.</strong> By redefining the key space, we can assume that any encryption scheme <span class="math inline">\(\Pi=(\mathsf{Gen},\mathsf{Enc},\mathsf{Dec})\)</span> satisfies</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Gen}\)</span> chooses a uniform key.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span> is deterministic.</li>
</ol>
<p>If so, why do we still need probabilistic <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span> in CPA-secure encryptions? Can’t we just make <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}\)</span> deterministic while still being CPA-secure?</p>
<p>The first thing to realize is that chosen-plaintext attacks are geared towards multiple encryptions (with the same secret key <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>), so when the adversary obtains a pair <span class="math inline">\((m_0, c_0)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\Pr[C=c_0\,|\,M=m_0] = 1\)</span>, <em>the key is already leaked</em>. (Recall that the adversary knows the <em>deterministic</em> algorithm <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}_k\)</span>, thus reversing <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> from known <span class="math inline">\(m_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_0\)</span> can be quite feasible; e.g., in a one-time pad, <span class="math inline">\(k = m_0 \oplus c_0\)</span>.) The only way to get around this is make <span class="math inline">\(\mathsf{Enc}_k\)</span> <em>probabilistic</em> (constructed from a <em>pseudorandom function</em>), such that an adversary cannot reverse the key efficiently within polynomial time.</p>
<p>Note that perfect secrecy is not possible under CPA, since there is a small possibility that the adversary will reverse the key (by, for example, traversing an exponentially large lookup table of all random bits) and succeed in the further indistinguishability experiment with a slightly higher (but negligible) probability.</p>
</section>
<section id="historical-exploits-of-many-time-pad" class="level2">
<h2>Historical exploits of many-time pad</h2>
<p>One-time pad is one of the most (provably) secure encryption schemes, and its secrecy does not rely on any computational hardness assumptions. However, it requires that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| \geq |\mathcal{M}|\)</span> (which in fact is a necessary condition for any perfectly secret scheme), thus its real-world use is limited.</p>
<p>The one-time key <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> (uniformly chosen from the key space <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span>) may <em>not</em> be simply reused in multiple encryptions. Assume that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| = |\mathcal{M}|\)</span>, for encryptions of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> messages, the message space is expanded to size <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{M}|^n\)</span>, while the key space remains <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{K}\)</span>, thus we have <span class="math inline">\(|\mathcal{K}| &lt; |\mathcal{M}|^n\)</span>. Such a degraded scheme (many-time pad) is theoretically insecure and vulnerable to several practical cryptanalyses.</p>
<p>A historical exploit of the vulnerability of many-time pad occurred in the VENONA project, where the U.S. Army’s Signal Intelligence Service (later the NSA) aimed at decrypting messages sent by the USSR intelligence agencies (KGB) over a span of 4 decades. As the KGB mistakenly reused some portions of their one-time key codebook, the SIS was able to break a good amount of the messages.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
